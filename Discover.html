        <h1>Some information about DOUZ</h1>
    
        <div>
            <h3>Douz :</h3> 
            <p>is a town in the Kebili Governorate in the south of Tunisia, known as the "gateway to the Sahara." By road it is located southwest of Blidet, southeast of Tozeur, and south of the Tunisian capital of Tunis.</p> 
<h3>History</h3>
  <p>It has been called the "ultimate palm oasis", because it has over 500,000 palm trees in the area, and it is a major producer of "diglat noor" dates.</p>        
           
      <h3>Culture :</h3>
          <p> Every year Douz hosts the International Festival of the Sahara, a four-day celebration of traditional desert culture. The festival, usually held in November or December, features traditional music and dancing, poetry readings, camel wrestling, and racing of horses and salugis. Douz is home to the Museum of the Sahara, which showcases displays on traditional nomadic desert culture of the Mrazig people who now mostly live a settled life in the town.</p>
